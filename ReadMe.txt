Project Description
Lookup IPod Menu is a JQuery implementation of a look up menu based on the IPod menu. It is ideal for browsing/selecting navigation structures like folders.
Inspiration

The project took inspiration from the Filament Group jQuery Menu control. Some additional things added in this project include
Ability to specify a path manually (auto complete)
Ability to render the look up control as a separate clickable breadcrumb item
Ability to select any level in the hierarchy from the breadcrumb item
Ability to select any item and not just the leaf nodes (items without any children)
This control is more suited to displaying hierarchical navigation structures.
